# VisionMate

**VisionMate** is an assistive technology project designed to empower visually impaired individuals by providing smart, real-time guidance for safer and more independent navigation.

## Project Overview

VisionMate aims to integrate advanced computer vision, text recognition, and speech technologies to help users:
- Identify objects and surroundings
- Read printed or handwritten text aloud
- Provide real-time feedback through a simple, user-friendly interface

This is the early development and ideation phase. The repository will include prototypes, research notes, and starter code as the project progresses.

## Features (Planned)

✅ Object detection using computer vision  
✅ Text-to-speech functionality  
✅ Speech-based user controls  
✅ Environment awareness for obstacle detection  
✅ Modular architecture for future feature integration  

## Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core backend and computer vision  
- **OpenCV** – Image processing and recognition  
- **Flask / Django** – Backend framework (to be finalized)  
- **React.js / Flutter** – Frontend or app interface  
- **MySQL** – Data storage  
- **Google Cloud Vision API** – (future integration)  
- **Text-to-Speech / Speech-to-Text APIs** – Accessibility tools

## Getting Started
